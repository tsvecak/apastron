# [Video.js][vjs] Documentation

There are two categories of docs: [Guides][guides] and [API docs][api].

Guides explain general topics and use cases (e.g. setup). API docs are automatically generated from the codebase and give specific details about functions, properties, and events.

## Guides

### Getting Started

#### [Setup][guides-setup]

The setup guide covers all methods of setting up Video.js players. After mastering the basics, see the [player workflows guide][guides-workflow].

#### [Options][guides-options]

There are a number of options that can be used to change how the player behaves, starting with the HTML5 media options like autoplay and preload, and expanding to Video.js specific options.

#### [Tracks][guides-tracks]

Tracks are used for displaying text information over a video, selecting different audio tracks for a video, or selecting different video tracks.

### Customizing

#### [Skins][guides-skins]

You can change the look of the player across playback technologies just by editing a CSS file. The skins documentation gives you a intro to how the HTML and CSS of the default skin is put together.

#### [Plugins][guides-plugins]

You can package up interesting Video.js customizations and reuse them elsewhere. Find out how to build your own plugin or [use one created by someone else](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Plugins).

#### [Components][guides-components]

Video.js is built around a collection of components. These are the building blocks of the player UI.

#### [Tech][guides-tech]

A "tech" is the shorthand we're using to describe any video playback technology - be it HTML5 video, Flash, . Basically anything that has a unique API to audio or video. Additional playback technologies can be added relatively easily.

## API Docs

You can refer to the [full list of API docs][api], but the most relevant API doc is for the [Player][api-player].
